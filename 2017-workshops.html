Most of Nine Worlds is turn-up-and-go for ticket holders. However, some content is more selective, usually because it has limits on participants or costs extra:

<h2>Payable, ticketed sessions</h2>
We'll be launching ticketed sessions this Saturday at 10am, and we expect some to sell out very quickly. This isn't something we can do much about, unfortunately, as we have limited space and don't want to displace too much of our general content with ticketed sessions. Check back here on Saturday at 10am to purchase tickets.

<h3 id="swordpunk">Swordpunk</h3>

<h2>One to one feedback sessions</h2>
These are free for Nine Worlds attendees, but capacity is strictly limited, and the people involved need your work in advance to read through it and prepare their thoughts. We'll be updating this page on Saturday to include details of how to submit your work.

<h3 id="comics">Comics feedback with Kieron Gillen</h3>
Comics creators, want to learn how to improve your comics? At Nine Worlds, award-winning comics writer <a href="https://sites.grenadine.co/sites/nineworlds/en/2017/participants/630/Kieron+Gillen">Kieron Gillen</a> (The Wicked + The Divine, Young Avengers, Darth Vader) is offering one-to-one feedback sessions of 15-30 minutes. We’re looking for finished work including artwork, not just scripts, of between 1 and 20 pages. We can’t promise to accept everyone who asks. And Kieron can only give feedback – he can’t get you a job!

To be in with a chance of this, email us at tonyk@nineworlds.co.uk, attaching your work, and giving us your name, email, and when you're available. Please do so by midnight on Wednesday 26 July. Successful applicants will be informed before the convention starts. Please note that you will need to have a ticket to Nine Worlds to take part.

<h3 id="manuscript">Manuscript feedback for genre fiction</h3>
Literary agent <a href="http://www.johnsonandalcock.co.uk/ed-wilson/">Ed Wilson</a> at Johnson & Alcock has offered to provide free, in-person feedback on a 1-page synopsis and the first 10 pages of any genre manuscript. This will be in 10-minute slots at a time to be agreed on the <strong>Friday only</strong> of Nine Worlds. We can't promise to accept everyone who asks, and sending in a manuscript doesn't impose any obligations in either direction.

To be in with a chance of this, email the synopsis and first ten pages of the book to edwilson@nineworlds.co.uk, attaching your work in a single document. Please do so by midnight on Wednesday 26 July. Successful applicants will be informed by email before the convention starts, and will need to agree a time to meet up with Ed.

<h2 id="atEvent">Sessions requiring at-event sign-up</h2>
Some sessions, while free to attend, still have limited capacity and require sign-up in advance. We'll have sign-up sheets on the info desk in the hotel, but they may only be available at set times. We'll update this page with more details of the sign-up process closer to the time of the event. For now, the sessions in question are:
