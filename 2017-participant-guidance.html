Thank you for agreeing to appear on programme at Nine Worlds this year. We wouldn’t be able to put on a convention without people like you being willing to contribute their time and expertise, and we’re all incredibly grateful.

We’ve put together some guidelines to give everyone the same baseline knowledge before they appear on programme at Nine Worlds. Please give it a read even if you’ve taken part in Nine Worlds before - a refresher is always useful, especially as we’ve made a few changes since last year.

<h2 id="everyone">Guidance for everyone</h2>

These guidelines apply to everyone presenting or taking part in a talk, panel, or workshop at Nine Worlds. Parts of them are also useful for people running games or entertainments. There’s specific guidance about moderating panels and roundtables at the end; we recommend reading those sections if you’re moderating, on a panel or planning to take part in a roundtable, but otherwise feel free to skip them.

<h3 id="before">Before getting to the con</h3>

This year we’ll be back at the Novotel in Hammersmith (our 2016 venue), which is accessible by a <a href="/2017/travel">wide range of transport options</a>. Contrary to the opinion of Gandalf the Grey, unexpected journeys aren’t always fun - check the website and plan your travel in advance!

We also have <a href="/access">extensive access information</a> - if you have specific access needs, and you need clarification on what accommodations are available, please contact our Access Co-ordinator on access@nineworlds.co.uk.

Make sure that you’ve checked your schedule of appearances and arrive as far in advance of your first session as possible. This includes leaving time to register for your con badge.

<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>

The Nine Worlds registration desk is not the same as the check in desk for the hotel. Our registration desk is located in the Champagne Suite on the first floor. It should be well signposted. When you reach registration, have your confirmation email with the name that your ticket(s) are booked under, ready. You can show it to us on your device if you’d rather not print it, but remember not to rely on the hotel wifi. If you bought your own ticket, or your ticket was comped by Nine Worlds, we will have emailed the confirmation direct to you. If it was bought by a friend, they will have the confirmation email. If you’re going to register separately, please ask them to send it to you and agree who’s going to collect which ticket(s).

<h3 id="gettingtosession">Getting to Your Session</h3>

Nine Worlds does not use a green room; this helps us avoid making unnecessary distinctions between speakers and attendees. Content rooms have been chosen based on expected audience demand, or the number of places available for a session. This means that you need to spend a few minutes acquainting yourself with the map, which will be in your goodie bag.

You are encouraged to arrive at the room where your session will be held 10-15 minutes before it starts. The standard break in programme is 45 minutes, so you have time to grab some water before you head from one session to the next. Everything should be well sign-posted, but if you get lost, we will have volunteers dotted about the place who can give you directions - most of them will be in hi-vis vests, or wearing staff badges on their lanyards.

When you arrive at your room, we ask that you don’t impede any volunteers clearing up from the previous session, or setting up for yours. If you’re part of a panel, your fellow panellists should also turn up a few minutes early, so you can all say hello to each other, and make sure everyone knows each other's names and pronouns, etc. (see more panel-specific guidelines below).

Most sessions last for one hour. There will always be a Nine Worlds staff member or volunteer either in the room, or nearby your session in case you need help, or in the unlikely event something goes wrong.

<h3 id="tech">Tech facilities - audio, video, wifi</h3>

It’s especially important that you arrive at your programme room a little early if you are running a session that has tech requirements (for showing slides or videos, for example). Most of our large content rooms, and one large workshop room, have sound amplification and projectors available – email us at content@nineworlds.co.uk if you need to double-check. Note that you must bring your own laptop to show slides or videos. If you are bringing your presentation on a Mac, please also bring the appropriate adaptor for VGA or HDMI as we probably won’t have these.

Please note, we can’t have content relying on the hotel wifi, as we will have over 1,000 data hungry geeks trying to use it at once, and it may fall over, which would mean your session would be without a potentially-pivotal clip of [spoiler] getting [spoilered] on Game of Thrones. If you do want to show video clips, there are <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PaZP31y9DfkbpiQ4xEJWkye5kHiZnhazJeaHb4jI9wU/edit">various ways</a> to download these in advance.

<h3 id="access">Making Your Session Accessible</h3>

We would like to make as much material as possible available in large print format, for visually impaired attendees to follow along, and to give them an opportunity to examine pictures up close. If you intend to use any printable materials (e.g. a slide presentation) in your programme item, please send it to us at content@nineworlds.co.uk. We will print some copies at an appropriate size and get them in the correct room, so please make sure you mention them when you’re introducing your session.

Some sessions at the con will have a BSL interpreter. Their time is being allocated according to demand, so they may or may not come to your session. If your session is being interpreted, we may get in touch to ask whether you have any material to pass to the interpreter in advance. It’s particularly helpful to get copies of any pre-scripted materials in advance, such as songs, poems, etc. These can be sent to access@nineworlds.co.uk.

Most content rooms will have microphones. Even if you are very good at projecting your voice, it is imperative that you use the microphone provided. Some of our attendees are hearing aid users and will be using the loop systems present in the content rooms, which rely on you using the microphones. Using a mic can be daunting if you haven’t done it before, but it is fine to speak normally into it, without putting it against your mouth. Don’t turn your head away; focus on the microphone. Please don’t tap it, as the amplified sudden noise can cause pain to D/deaf people present and also damage the microphone itself. If there are technical issues with the sound, please get someone from tech to address this as soon as possible, as it may otherwise render your session inaccessible to some audience members.

If your session is in one of the smaller rooms and is not amplified, or there is no audience mic, please repeat audience questions so everyone can hear. Try to use the words of the person asking the question, rather than paraphrasing.

Whether or not you have a microphone, please try not to cover your mouth or face away from the audience while speaking; this makes it difficult for lip readers. Be aware of noise levels in your session; excessive noise can make it difficult for people with sensory difficulties to focus on what is going on and can disrupt other sessions.

<h3 id="during">During the session</h3>

The moderator, presenter or chair should start by thanking the audience for coming, and confirming the session title to make sure everyone is in the right place (some people might have ended up in the wrong room, and it’s better to let them exit now than have them realise 10 minutes in that this is a session about Orange is the New Black, not Orphan Black).

If the session relates to a difficult, distressing or potentially triggering topic that people might not want to hear about, please give content warnings at the beginning. Give people a minute or two to leave while you go through the rest of the session housekeeping.

If there will be some discussion of such material (for example, covering transphobia during an Orange is the New Black session) but it won’t be the whole of the session, and wasn’t mentioned in the program, you can give it a designated time so people can choose to participate in the rest of the session. This is optional, but encouraged as a way of ensuring that as many people as possible can participate. A sample way of handling this would be to say:

<blockquote>This session is on identity politics in Orange is the New Black. There will be a segment of this discussion addressing portrayals of transphobia. That conversation will last for a maximum of ten minutes, and we will let you know before it starts, in case anyone wants to leave and come back when it’s over.</blockquote>

If you do use this process, please make sure you remember to flag that topic when it comes up. If anyone does leave the room, ask for an audience member near the door to invite them back in when the discussion is over.

Remind people whether or not the session is designated as 18+. If it isn’t, ask people (including the audience) to keep swearing and explicit content to a minimum. If you are dealing with subject matter that would be classified as an 18 in a movie (graphic violence, sexual content, etc.), make sure that nobody tries to give a blow by blow description of a graphic scene. This is especially true in sessions that haven’t been labelled 18+. A summary will do just fine. Saying “Oberyn Martell’s death” probably contextualises the point just as well as giving a blow by blow of how his head went squish.

If you’re not going to be taking audience comments until a certain point, make that clear at the beginning with a comment like “we’ll open this up to audience questions in about 30 minutes.”  This will ensure your audience is paying attention and not just waiting for their turn to speak.

<h3 id="inclusivity">Inclusivity and Anti-Harassment</h3>

All of our speakers and attendees are subject to <a href="/anti-harassment-policy">our anti-harassment policy</a>. These are our fairly basic 101 “Don’t be mean to people” rules, and cover all of the “-isms” and “-phobias” (racism, transphobia, ableism, homophobia, sexism, etc.) and you should read them, even if you are a person who is affected by an -ism or -phobia. It is important to note that it also applies to how Nine Worlds attendees treat hotel staff. If you were found to be in breach of it, you could be asked to leave the con.

Our inclusive speech policy is broader, and focuses on not accidentally alienating people from marginalised identity groups. This includes things like:

<ul>
  <li>Not gendering the audience either when you’re welcoming people (don’t say “hello ladies and gentlemen”) or identifying an audience member to respond to the panel (don’t pick out “the lady in the red shirt”). You can’t tell someone’s gender accurately by looking at them, and not everyone identifies as male or female, so it is best to keep things gender neutral. A gender neutral welcome could be “hello everybody” and a good way to call upon audience members to speak is to pick an item of clothing, and the part of the room they’re sitting in, e,g. “The person in the Harley Quinn hoodie in the third row” or “You at the back, with the green and purple hair” are good examples of how to do this.</li>

  <li>Please don’t comment on people’s cosplays (even as a compliment) while you’re behind a mic, even if it’s intended positively. It can make people feel very awkward. If you like their cosplay, let them know later in the bar, not while you have control of a microphone in a room full of people.</li>

  <li>Avoiding sweeping generalisations about identity groups - especially ones you are not a part of.</li>

  <li>Don’t reference other speakers’ attractiveness (even as a compliment) - it is almost certain that your fellow panellist was chosen based on their knowledge of a topic, not for being beautiful. Commenting on their beauty undermines their position of expertise. This is often done to women in panel settings.</li>
</ul>

If you accidentally get one of these things wrong (and we do understand that this happens), don’t make it about how difficult you find it to use inclusive language. Apologise once and move on.

<h3 id="audiences">Audience Participation</h3>

We encourage you to include a Q&A (Questions and Answers) or audience participation slot as part of your session. Announce at the beginning how you plan to do this, and try to stick to the plan.

If audience members interrupt during a part of the session where you aren’t taking questions, let them know quickly, politely and firmly, even if it means interrupting them mid-sentence. “Sorry, we’re not taking audience comments right now” is an absolutely reasonable thing to say.

If you’re only taking questions, make that clear at the beginning of audience participation. Some people will want to make comments that don’t have a question attached - it should become fairly clear as they talk whether this is a question or comment. It is okay to remind people to keep questions short and focused, especially if you’ve fielded a couple of rambling ones. “Thank you, but we’re focusing on questions right now” is a fine thing to say if you don’t want to take comments, and someone tries to make one anyway.

Please bear in mind our inclusive language policy. Don’t gender people when you’re identifying them (use a neutral feature like clothing, location or hair colour instead), and don’t comment on their cosplay.

Be mindful of who you’re calling on - its fine to invite comment from someone making a lot of noise and drawing attention to themselves, but if it’s done repeatedly, then it’s disadvantaging people who don’t feel comfortable doing that. Keep in mind Nine Worlds’ ethos of inclusivity - make sure a variety of people get to speak.

<h3 id="wrong">What to Do if Things Go Wrong</h3>

We sometimes discuss difficult topics at Nine Worlds. Part of being inclusive means hearing different points of view. If discussion gets heated, make sure that it stays respectful. This can involve shutting people down if they’re getting too combative, but you can also troubleshoot discussions turning sour by moving on to someone else who has indicated that they would like to speak, or bringing a topic to a close, and selecting a new one.

If someone (whether a panellist or audience member) says something offensive, oppressive, or insulting in a session you’re running, it is absolutely fine to shut them down. This very rarely happens, but it’s good to know what you can do if it does. If someone uses offensive or oppressive language, you can cut them off from talking. Say “that isn’t an appropriate thing to say” and move directly onto the next person waiting to speak. You don’t need to pause the discussion to educate them on why [the oppressive thing] is inappropriate, and if you are asked to do so, you can simply say “it’s not the topic of the session” and move on. If anything more disruptive is said or done, get a staff member or steward to help you handle it. Con staff can take it from there.

When you’re ready to continue, it can help to move to a different point, question, or person, to reset the mood. If you’ve had a tough time and would like to de-brief after your session, come and see us on the infodesk. The quiet room is also available to you if that would help more.

<h3 id="after">After Your Session</h3>

After your session finishes, you are free to go and enjoy the rest of the con as you see fit. Audience members might want to chat to you after your session has finished, and while lots of people are okay with this, you are not obliged to stay and chat - you can either say no outright, or you can use our communication system to indicate that you don’t want to be spoken to. If you are feeling particularly unable to cope with people at the end of your session, we do have a quiet room that you can use. It is located on the second floor, close to the escalators.

If you need con staff to support you for any reason, go to the info desk and they’ll find someone to help you.

<h2 id="panels">Moderating a Panel</h2>

Much of the above advice applies to moderators, as well as workshop instructors, entertainers and individual speakers, but we’ve put together some specific advice for handling panels.

<h3 id="preparation">Before the Con</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that you’ve read the session description, especially if you didn’t write it!  It might be useful to make some notes on topics you think should come up, based on the description. If you need to check that your understanding matches what’s been written (it probably does, but once second guessing sets in it can be hard to shake!), get in touch with the your content contact. If you don’t know who that is, or you don’t get a timely response, you can always email content@nineworlds.co.uk. We are here to make sure everything runs smoothly - don’t hesitate to get in touch.</li>

<li>You should also be introduced via email to everyone appearing on your session a couple of weeks before the con at the latest. Feel free to get to know each other if you don’t already, and sketch out any topics or questions you want to cover, as a group. This would be the time to decide what sort of format you want the session to take - do you want to take questions from the audience at any point (this is how most panels at Nine Worlds run), or stick to a pre-agreed script of questions?  You can decide this as a group - there isn’t generally a wrong answer. If you’re in touch as a group, but haven’t heard from a specific panellist at all by one week before the con, get in touch with us at content@nineworlds.co.uk and we’ll check in to make sure everything is okay.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="formats">Formats for panels</h3>

If there’s a main question to your panel topic (for example “Are women well represented in Star Wars?”) and there’s a strong split in opinions between panellists, you could set it up as an informal debate. If you do this, sit the panellists who agree with each other together, and the moderator in the middle.

If you’re all of fairly mixed opinions, or there’s no specific overarching question to be answered, then setting the panel as more of a conversation is great. In this case, sit the panellists together, with you at one end to avoid stilting the conversation.

<h3 id="atconvention">At the con</h3>

As Nine Worlds doesn’t operate a green room, there isn’t a pre-designated spot to meet other panellists before your session, but you can arrange to meet up for a chat in advance of your session in a number of places:

<ul>
<li><strong>The Reg Desk</strong>. This is where you collected your badge when you checked into the con. The Reg Desk staff will be busy, so they won’t be able to help wrangle your panelists, but as a focal point it will be pretty easy to find.</li>

<li><strong>One of the bars</strong>. If you want to meet up for an extended discussion more than a few minutes before your panel, this may be your best bet. Depending on when in the day you arrange to meet, we can’t guarantee it will be accessible in terms of background noise.</li>

<li><strong>The room where your session will be</strong>. There is a break of 45 minutes between sessions. You are welcome to show up at the room at any point during this break - just make sure you don’t impede tech or volunteers sorting out the room.</li>
</ul>

Bring any notes you and your panellists made in your intro emails, and some note-taking method with you to your panel, so you can make brief notes if there’s a subject you want to come back to, or if you need track speaker or audience contributions. You may also wish to have some way to keep track of the time (watch, smart phone, sundial), but we don’t recommend phone alarms - if your phone is sat on the table and it starts to vibrate, it can mess with people’s concentration.

Decide how much time you want to attribute to particular discussion topics, and keep this with you as a loose guide, but remember tangents will happen - so long as discussion keeps flowing and it’s not going too far off track, this is great!

Before the audience settles and starts to notice you, make sure you are familiar with the panellists, that you know which panellist is which, what their pronouns are, and make sure that you are all pronouncing each other’s names correctly. If you would like to ask panellists to introduce themselves, please don’t surprise them into announcing their pronouns. Ask if they’re comfortable with that before the session starts.

<h3 id="panels">Running a Panel</h3>

Once you have confirmed the session title and when you’ll be inviting audience participation, and given any necessary content warnings, you should introduce any fellow panellists - or have them introduce themselves. If you are introducing them, please don’t compliment anyone on their looks, as this is reductive and undermines their authority. “The always beautiful so-and-so” is not a great compliment. “The brilliant so-and-so” is better. If they’re on a panel because they have a passionate interest or a professional expertise, use that in the intro - that’s why they’re here.

After you’ve posed a topic, follow it up - let the conversation go where it's interesting. Listen to the panellists, note down interesting points they’re making and come back to them. Avoid yes/no questions, to keep the conversation flowing - 5W (who what where when why) questions are better for this.

Pay attention to who is talking, and how much. Be mindful that some people find it easier than others to be assertive in group discussions. If you see the discussion becoming unfairly weighted with one panellist speaking lots more than others, target the ones speaking less with your next questions.

If you have a panellist who is interrupting others, liberal deployment of the phrase “hold on, if we could let [speaker] finish first” is encouraged. Try to actually follow up with the interrupter at some point (unless they’ve been completely dominating the discussion), as their point may well be brilliant when it’s not shutting down someone else’s or jumping the queue if there is one.

Some people might need encouragement to give their opinion - this may be because they aren’t sure when it’s appropriate to jump in. A good way to do this is to ask them what they think of another speaker’s comment.

When asking panellists to respond to points either from your list of questions, or the audience, change the order up - if Kurt started first last time, let Jubilee start first this time to keep things fresh and avoid it becoming formulaic. The conversation should be free flowing - if someone doesn’t have an opinion on one of the questions, that’s fine - not everyone has to answer every question.

When you have about 10 minutes left, start wrapping things up. Finish up the current question, or take a final one, depending on how deep the discussion is at this point. You don’t have to draw a final unified conclusion on the session topic.

With five minutes or so to go, invite the panellists to make any closing remarks they would like. Thank each of your panellists by name, and join in with the audience giving your panellists a round of applause. Thank your audience for coming, and remind them that they can carry on the conversation in the bar.

<h2 id="roundtables">Moderating a Roundtable</h2>

Much of the guidance around moderating panels also applies to roundtables (as does the other guidance in this document) – especially if you regard the audience as your panellists. However, we have some specific advice applying to roundtables only.

If you’re running a roundtable, decide exactly how you intend the interaction between you and participants to work. If you’re worried about whether people will be ready to participate, it’s fine to recruit a few willing volunteers to bounce ideas off in advance. Encourage them to attend the session, so you know you have ways to get the discussion started.

Decide whether you will ask questions of individual audience members, or bounce questions off your primed volunteers, and move on to the rest of the audience when it feels natural? There is no single ‘right’ way to do this, but make sure you’re ready to communicate the process at the beginning of the session. It’s OK to keep the discussion to one person at a time and limit contributions if necessary, but please don’t use a ‘talking stick.’ Even if you have a full understanding of and are prepared to thoroughly acknowledge and respect the cultural context of that practice, that isn’t the topic at hand (but if you do have that knowledge, talk to us about next year)?

You should be prepared to adapt your plans to the size of the audience if necessary, and be flexible on the subject-matter. People at roundtables are normally happy to get a chance to talk about a topic they feel passionate about - if that means going off script a little, that’s fine.

It's OK to re-arrange the furniture in the room you’re using, to suit a more roundtable format. The workshop rooms may already be set up for this, but feel free to move theatre-style seating around. Let us know about this requirement in advance if you can, so we can send some volunteers to do it for you, and reset it afterwards. If you move furniture yourself, the participants will probably help if they’re able to. Please let one of our volunteers know afterwards, so we can reset the room for the next session.

Try to wrap up the discussion around 10 minutes before the scheduled end time. Let people know whether you’re happy to continue the in the bar. This often happens after roundtables, but don’t feel obliged to do join in – people can always continue without you.
