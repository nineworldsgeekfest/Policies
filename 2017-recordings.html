Lots of people take photos at Nine Worlds, and it's not unusual for presenters, performers and panellists to want their contributions preserved for posterity. However, we have to balance that with the right to privacy of all of our attendees. We've put together guidance on photography, audio recordings, and filming, which applies to all attendees, including press and participants. Please read this to learn how to preserve your privacy, and how to make a record of the event in a way that respects our attendees' wishes.

<h2>Photography policy</h2>

We’d love to see your photos of the event: tweet @London_Geekfest, Instagram @nworlds, and tag pictures with #nineworlds. If you’ve got some good photos and you’d like to donate them to us to use and publish more widely, email them to photos@nineworlds.co.uk.

<h3>Attendees</h3>

We’ll be taking lots of photos at the event, including crowd shots, which we’ll be using for publicity. If you don’t want to be photographed, please swap your lanyard for a bright yellow “no-photo” lanyard at the Registration Desk or the Info Desk, and wear it.

<h3>Photographers</h3>

Please ask your subjects for their permission first: it’s only polite. Some people will be wearing bright yellow no-photo lanyards - you must ensure you don’t photograph them, even if they’re in the background.

<h2>Recording policy</h2>

Nine Worlds values the privacy of our attendees and speakers. Regrettably, we can’t allow the audience or the press to record sessions. Speakers may record audio of their own sessions, provided they follow the rules below.

<h3>Consent</h3>

Please obtain informed consent from everyone who will feature in the recording. This includes any fellow panellists or co-presenters. Don’t put people on the spot; either email them in advance, or speak to them before the session starts. Let them know what you intend to do with the recording so they can make an informed decision.

Please announce at the start of the session that it is being recorded, and what you intend to do with the recording.The easy way to deal with consent for audience questions is to save them for the end of the session, and stop the recording before the questions begin. If you want to deal with it differently, please make sure there is an opportunity for people to ask questions ‘off the record’ as well as on it.

<h3>Tech</h3>

The best way to record sessions is directly onto your device, using the audio output from our tech. However, we can only allow the equipment to be operated by approved tech volunteers (this includes plugging your own device into our output). If you wish to record your session using our tech, please contact us on content@nineworlds.co.uk, telling us the title, day, time,  and room. Be aware that we have very limited capacity for providing tech volunteers to help with recording. We may have to say no. Please respect that decision and do not touch the tech setup. Audio outputs are only available as dual stereo unbalanced 6.3mm TS jack, or dual stereo unbalanced RCA/phono connectors, so please ensure that you have any required adapters with you already. Whilst the equipment has stereo TRS 6.3/3.5mm connectors for headphones, these are reserved for tech volunteer use only, in order to monitor the audio.

Provided you have the appropriate consents, you are welcome to audio-record your session using your own equipment, which could be as simple as a mobile phone or dictaphone placed on the table. Please be aware that mains power is not necessarily going to be available, and that any equipment must not be bulky to the point where it interferes with the use of the room, or safe evacuation. Any cables that your equipment uses must not be trailed across any area subject to foot traffic.

Unauthorised equipment or connections may be removed without warning.

<h3>Interviews</h3>

You may record audio interviews with anyone who gives their informed consent. Let them know before you start what you intend to do with the recording. Take care not to record people who have not given their consent. If you need a quiet location, we suggest trying the ground floor (group entrance) lobby, which may be quieter than the first floor areas.

<h2>Filming policy</h2>

Nine Worlds values the privacy of our attendees and speakers. Regrettably, we can’t allow the audience or press to film sessions. Speakers may film their own sessions, provided they follow the rules below:

<h3>Consent</h3>

Please obtain informed consent from everyone who will feature in shot at any time. This includes any fellow panellists or co-presenters. Don’t put people on the spot; either email them in advance, or speak to them before the session starts. Let them know what you intend to do with the film so they can make an informed decision.

Please announce at the start of the session that it is being filmed, and what you intend to do with the end product. Take care to only film the speaker(s) who have consented. The easy way to deal with consent for audience questions is to save them for the end of the session, and stop the filming before the questions begin. If you want to deal with it differently, please make sure there is an opportunity for people to ask questions ‘off the record’ as well as on it.

You may *not* film anyone (including the audience) without their informed consent, and under no circumstances may you film anyone wearing a yellow ‘no photo’ lanyard.

<h3>Tech</h3>

We are not providing any equipment capable of filming sessions, so you will need to bring this yourself. The best way to record audio will be directly onto your device, using the audio output from our tech. However, we can only allow the equipment to be operated by approved tech volunteers (this includes plugging your own device into our output). If you wish to record audio using our tech, please contact us on content@nineworlds.co.uk, telling us the title, day, time and room.

Whilst the equipment has stereo TRS 6.3/3.5mm connectors for headphones, these are reserved for tech volunteer use only, in order to monitor the audio.

Provided you have the appropriate consents, you are welcome to audio-record your session using your own equipment exclusively. Please be aware that mains power is not necessarily going to be available, and that any equipment must not be bulky to the point where it interferes with the use of the room, or safe evacuation. Any cables that your equipment uses must not be trailed across any area subject to foot traffic

Unauthorised equipment or connections may be removed without warning.

<h3>Filming around the convention</h3>

Please obtain informed consent from everyone who will feature in shot or audio at any time (including hotel staff and non-convention visitors). You may *not* film anyone without their informed consent, and under no circumstances may you film anyone wearing a yellow ‘no photo’ lanyard, even in the background.

<h3>Interviews</h3>

You may film interviews with anyone who gives their informed consent. Let them know before you start what you intend to do with the end product.
