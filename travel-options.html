If you're travelling to Nine Worlds by train, it's advisable to book a few weeks or months in advance to get the cheapest fares. People are already booking their trains now!

<h2 id="hotel">Finding the Novotel once you're in Hammersmith</h2>
Whether you are coming from one of the nearby public transport options or arriving in a car or taxi, you may wish to use the ground level (coach party) entrance off Shortlands. The lifts in the alternative (glass-covered) entrance are very small, and not suitable for those with suitcases or mobility aids. Drivers please take care as you pull in from Shortlands, as the step-free route requires people to use the road for a short stretch.
<h3 id="step-free">Step-free access from public transport</h3>
Dropped kerbs in the pavements around the Novotel entrance are annoyingly sparse. If you are coming from either of the Hammersmith underground stations or the bus station, we recommend heading for the big glass L'Oreal building at the North-East corner of the roundabout that surrounds the Hammersmith Broadgate shopping centre. Instructions from there are below.
<img src="/sites/nineworlds.co.uk/files/pagefiles/Final%20step%20free%20map.PNG">
<br>
To get to the L’Oreal building <strong>from the Circle and Hammersmith & City line station</strong>, turn left on exit and then cross the roads going straight ahead until you reach the L'Oreal building.
<br>
To get to the L’Oreal building <strong>from the District and Piccadilly line station at Hammersmith</strong>, the ideal exit is through the bus station ground floor exit on the North East corner. The L'Oreal building is just across the road to your right. If you find yourself using another exit, keep turning right around the shopping centre until you get to the bus station and can see the L'Oreal building. The alternative route involves crossing and re-crossing roads under the Hammersmith Flyover. There is constant maintenance work and the route may not be clear.
<br>
<strong>Now you've found the L'Oreal building</strong>, head South towards the Hammersmith Flyover. If you need step-free access, don't take the pathway to the left through the tunnel, even though it's marked Novotel – the dropped kerb there is hard to find and can be blocked by a parked vehicle. Instead, carry on towards the flyover. Turn left at the corner, go alongside the building, and turn left on the landscaped path as soon as you can.
<br>
Once you are outside the Novotel glass entrance on Shortlands (which you should ignore), use the dropped kerb to go down onto the tarmac. Turn left and carefully navigate the short stretch to the underground entrance, staying on the tarmac. Beware of vehicles entering the underground car park and drop-off.
<br>
<em>Note: There is ramped access to the first floor of the hotel from the A315 Hammersmith Road. However, this ramp is in very poor condition, floods right across if it rains, and is likely to wreck wheels on wheelchairs and suitcases. We don't recommend it unless you are luggage-free, dry, able-bodied and careful.</em>
<br>
<h3 id="registration">Registration and check-in</h3>
Please use the bank of lifts next to the concierge to head for the first floor, where you will find convention registration and hotel check-in.

<h2 id="public-in-london">Public transport inside London</h2>
There is step-free access to the venue from the nearby Tube and bus stations, approaching via Talgarth Road. To plan journeys taking account of access requirements, the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/plan-a-journey/">TfL Journey Planner has access options</a>.

<h3 id="tube">Tube routes</h3>
There are two Underground stations in close proximity to the venue: Hammersmith (Hammersmith & City and Circle lines) is 8 minutes walk away at average walking speed, and Hammersmith (District and Piccadilly lines) is 6 minutes.

Both stations have step-free access from the platform to street level. However, there are gaps and/or steps from the train to the platform at both stations. The Hammersmith & City line has small gaps and largely level access between the train and the platform. The District line eastbound platform has a 220mm step and a 33mm gap. The District line westbound platform has a 253mm step and a 40mm gap. The Piccadilly line eastbound has a 179mm step and a 110mm gap. The Piccadilly line westbound has a 187mm step and a 102mm gap. Please consult the <a href="http://content.tfl.gov.uk/step-free-tube-guide-map.pdf">Step Free Tube Guide map</a> (pdf) for more information.

The Night Tube is now in operation during the convention, so the Piccadilly line will run all night on Friday and Saturday night.

<h3 id="bus">Bus routes</h3>
The area is also comprehensively served by TfL buses. All TfL buses are capable of carrying wheelchair users or unfolded pushchairs, depending on available capacity. Please give priority to wheelchair users.

Please note that London buses do not accept cash. You will need to <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/buses/cash-free-buses">pay using contactless cards or a pre-purchased travel card</a>.

<h3 id="paying">Paying for London public transport</h3>
Tickets for public transport in London can be acquired by several different ways. Those of you travelling by train may purchase an additional travelcard as an add-on to your train ticket. In addition you can use an <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster">Oyster card</a>, or simply tap the Oyster card reader with your contactless credit or debit card. Oyster cards no longer provide the ability to purchase a travelcard, because <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/using-oyster/price-capping">Oyster price capping</a> results in a cheaper fare for the same effect.

<h3 id="taxi">Taxi</h3>
The area is further served by a large number of London “black cabs” - black cabs can carry a maximum of five passengers, and have ramped access for wheelchair users. Users of large powered wheelchairs, please be aware that the headroom is restricted. Larger vehicles can be booked on request from local taxi and private hire companies.

Please do not board a vehicle that stops for you at the kerb unless it is a licensed London Taxi; licensed private hire vehicles can only be pre-booked by telephone and come to your location. London may, at times, contain large numbers of unlicensed operators of taxi-like objects.

<h2 id="public-to-london">Reaching London by public transport</h2>
Public transport routes to London will deliver you to the city's tube network. For international travellers, Heathrow Airport is on the Piccadilly line or around 15 miles drive down the A4.
<h3 id="coach">Coaches from major cities</h2>
Coaches from numerous towns and cities in the West and South West of the UK call at <a href="http://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/hammersmith-coach.pdf">Hammersmith Bus and Coach Station</a> (pdf), which is 5 minutes walk from the venue. For coach travel from other locations, Victoria Coach Station is approximately 20 minutes by Underground from Hammersmith. The closest Tube station to Victoria Coach Station is Victoria Underground, which is around 300m walking distance to the ticket gates. Regrettably, neither the Victoria line or District & Circle line platforms at Victoria Underground station have step free access.
<h3 id="rail">Rail from major cities</h2>
London has a large number of national rail terminals, the closest of which are Paddington and Marylebone. All rail terminals provide assistance for disabled users, but it should generally be booked in advance to guarantee assistance. Not all national rail terminals are able to provide step free access to the Tube (see the <a href="http://content.tfl.gov.uk/step-free-tube-guide-map.pdf">Step Free Tube Guide map</a> (pdf) for details), but buses and taxis will be generally available. If you do not have an oyster card, or contactless payment card, you may request that a London travelcard be added to your ticket for a nominal cost.

<h2 id="car">Getting here by car</h2>
The hotel is located just off the A4 and outside the Central London Congestion Zone, and is entered from Chalk Hill Road via Shortlands. We recommend that you use the underground drop-off point on the ground floor, which has larger lifts and better access generally. It also has a pay-by-the-hour below-ground car park.
