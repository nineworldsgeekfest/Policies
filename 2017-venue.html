This year's Nine Worlds will take place at the Novotel London West. We'll be running up to 250 programme items covering all aspects of modern geekery.

<h2>What's the venue like?</h2>
Novotel London West is a large conference hotel in central Hammersmith, with room for 2,000 attendees to enjoy Nine Worlds. In addition to the venue's bars, cafes, restaurants, and terraces, we'll have a mix of content and social spaces both large and small.

They were also our hosts in 2016, and were unfailingly polite, helpful and efficient in our interactions with them. We have worked closely with them over many months of discussion and negotiation, to ensure that attendees have an even better time than last year.

The hotel is in one of London's major leisure and commercial centres. It is <a href="/2017/travel">easily reachable by both public and private transport</a>. In addition to our onsite facilities, there are numerous eating, drinking, and boarding establishments in the immediate area.

<h2>Tell me more!</h2>

  <li><strong>Dedicated conference space</strong> - The main conference area is for attendees and staff only, so you can cosplay in peace.</li>

<h2 id="novotel-rooms">What are the hotel bedrooms like?</h2>
The hotel rooms are in the same building as the convention spaces. They each feature a queen bed, en-suite bath or shower, sofa bed, large flexible work area, 32" LCD TV, pay movies and Internet access, broadband connection, hairdryer, iron, laptop safe, minibar, and tea/coffee. There are a very small number of twin rooms, so most twin requests are accommodated by making up the sofa bed. Wheelchair accessible bedrooms have already been allocated to meet people's requests made through the access accommodation form, so you'll need to contact access@nineworlds.co.uk with any requests concerning those rooms.-->

<h2 id="accommodation">How do I book a hotel room?</h2>
All rooms at the event venue, the Novotel, appear to be booked out as of 4th June. There are many other local accommodation options, from hostels to Airbnbs to B&Bs to chain hotels. We've agreed a special rate with the <a href="http://www.k-west.co.uk/">K-West hotel</a>.

K-West is a former BBC recording studio on the edge of Shepherds Bush, now a large boutique hotel. This is one of the longer walks from this year's host venue at just under twenty minutes, although it's via quiet residential streets rather than the big dual carriageways. They have a range of single and double rooms, plus various upgrade offers including on-site spa treatments and the like. People who stayed there last year report being very satisfied with the hotel and its service. Cancellation and other terms are as normal and are shown on the website prior to booking.

We have a limited allocation of rooms, and the link above will stop working when they're sold out. <strong>Update 4th May - Thursday night is now sold out. There are about 10 rooms remaining on Friday and Saturday nights, and about 50 on Sunday night</strong>. For reference, we released the booking link as follows:

<strong>Friday 31st March: Priority booking</strong> - We've emailed a priority booking link to people who requested priority booking for access reasons, or who have child tickets. Be aware that the priority booking link is <strong>only</strong> for people on the priority booking list, and anyone not on the list who uses it will be barred from the convention.

<strong>Saturday 8th April: General release</strong> - We've emailed the booking link to all remaining ticket holders at 12pm British Summer Time (which is 11am GMT for people outside the UK). Unfortunately, the link stopped working for a couple of days after a few minutes; we believe the hotel's booking system was overwhelmed by the rush. We apologise for the effect this had on people seeking to book. If you ended up booking a non-convention rate room at the Novotel or at the nearby ibis hotel, <a href="mailto:venue@nineworlds.co.uk">email our venue team</a> and we'll pass on a request to transfer your reservation to the convention rate rooms at the Novotel. We also published the link on this webpage, and are emailing it to new ticket purchasers, until such time as the rooms are all booked.

There are 300 rooms in our block, and around 100 of these were taken by staff and priority booking people, leaving 200 available at the time of general release. This is roughly twice as many as last year, but we still expect them to be booked up quickly following general release. If staying on-site is very important to you but you aren't in the priority list, make sure you have email, a web browser and your card details to hand at the time of general launch.

Room rates per night, including free breakfast, are:
<ul>
<li>Single occupancy £95 - 1 adult, 0-2 children on sofa bed.</li>
<li>Double occupancy £105 - 2 adults sharing double bed, 0-2 children on sofa bed.</li>
<li>Triple occupancy £115 - 2 adults sharing double bed, 1 adult on sofa bed. Use the 'Message to the hotel' box in checkout to tell the hotel 3 adults will be staying in the room.</li>
</ul>
You'll need to use a credit or debit card to book, but payment will not be taken until your stay. Bookings are cancellable and refundable until 7 days prior to your stay. VAT is included.

If you have any special requirements, use the 'Message to the hotel' box on the checkout page of the booking form. This includes triple beds, twin beds (these are nearly nonexistent, so unless you really need and specify an actual twin, the hotel will set up the sofa bed as a second bed), rooms near an elevator, rooms on lower floors, and baby cots. Any comments will be picked up by the hotel reservations team during office hours so they can amend your booking, confirm any requests and prepare the room.-->

<strong>Wheelchair accessible rooms</strong> - We have already allocated on-site accessible rooms for people who require them, using the priority booking access survey. <!--If you are one of these people, phone the hotel front desk, give the name and email you gave on the access survey, and ask to book a wheelchair accessible room. When you phone, please specify whether you require an accessible room with a bath, an accessible room with a wetroom and a roll in shower seat, or an accessible room with a wetroom and a perch stool. -->Please be aware that, while we will be advocating for your needs with the hotel, your agreement is with them.
