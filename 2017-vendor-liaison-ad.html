Nine Worlds has experimented with different approaches to vendors over the last four years. For two years we ran a dedicated vendors room within the convention space, which was open each day to convention attendees only. One year a pop-up market took place on a single day, and in 2016 we ran a separate Expo alongside the convention. For 2017, we are moving the vendor space back into the main convention and running it as part of the convention, which will considerably reduce the workload and risk from last year's event.

The new vendor liaison will have an opportunity to review vendor feedback from 2016, and work with the management team and interested vendors to shape the event for 2017. This will mean working within the space constraints of our contract with the hotel.

<h4>Necessary</h4>
You will need:
<ul>
<li><strong>To be a confident and competent communicator</strong> - in writing and in person.</li>
<li><strong>To be willing to work as part of a team</strong> - Nine Worlds is built on teamwork. You need to be ready to work closely with the Nine Worlds management team, the venue events team, and the rest of the Nine Worlds organisation as required. </li>
<li><strong>Regular access to an internet-connected computer</strong> - All of our organising is carried out on-line, partly from necessity as it's difficult to get everyone in one place. We may be able to loan laptops or Chromebooks to volunteers for the duration of their role in organising the 2017 event. Daily communication isn’t always necessary, but we do need to know that you’re still engaged and working on things. Weekly check-ins are likely to be expected.</li>
<li><strong>The time and capacity to carry out the following tasks</strong> -  Work with the Nine Worlds management team to set out a plan for vendors at the 2017 event; deal with enquiries from interested vendors and approach those of interest to Nine Worlds; attend at least one site visit to the venue; assist with drafting the 2017 vendors contract (legal assistance is available); make a plan for the agreed space and draft a layout for vendor tables and other requirements; agree the list of accepted vendors with the management team; and administer the 2017 vendors agreement, obtaining signed copies well in advance of the event. </li>
<li><strong>At the convention</strong> - you will be expected to liaise with the venue and vendors; ensure that the space is set up correctly; that the load in and out processes are swift and successful; supervise the vendors space (with assistance as agreed), and dealing with all enquiries and problems relating to vendors. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Desirable</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vendor experience</strong> - If you've dealt with vendors, whether by helping to host them or by actually selling stuff, that will be an advantage. Even substantial experience in attending expo or vendor hall events counts for something, so please feel free to mention that.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding of barriers to inclusion faced by marginalised groups</strong> - Membership of a marginalised or disadvantaged group counts as lived experience.</li>
<li><strong>Experience with Slack, Trello and Google Apps</strong> - Introductory training can be provided if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reimbursement and justification</h4>
We expect this voluntary role to be taken up by people who are not professional event organisers in their day jobs, who would find volunteering for this interesting, personally rewarding and valuable for the Nine Worlds community.

In order to accommodate the requirements of this role, we expect to offer the vendor liaison a weekend membership to the convention, and a space in shared accommodation either at or near the convention hotel, from Thursday night until Sunday morning. We may also be able to reimburse travel expenses. We are also happy to write appropriate references for our volunteers.
