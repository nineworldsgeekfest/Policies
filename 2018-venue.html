Nine Worlds 2018 will take place at the Novotel London West. We'll be running up to 250 programme items covering all aspects of modern geekery.

<h2 id="top">What's the venue like?</h2>
Novotel London West is a large conference hotel in central Hammersmith, with room for 2,000 attendees to enjoy Nine Worlds. In addition to the venue's bars, cafes, restaurants, and terraces, we'll have a mix of content and social spaces both large and small.

They were also our hosts in 2016 and 2017. We have worked closely with them since the 2017 event to ensure that attendees have an even better time than last year.

The hotel is in one of London's major leisure and commercial centres. It is easily reachable by both public and private transport. In addition to our onsite facilities, there are numerous eating, drinking, and boarding establishments in the immediate area.

<h2>Tell me more!</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lots of rooms for content</strong> - Lots of large conference rooms, meaning we can run load of different things at once, all weekend.</li>
  <li><strong>Dedicated conference space</strong> - The main conference area is for attendees and staff only, so you can cosplay in peace.</li>
  <li><strong>Space to chill</strong> - There's a lot of social space to relax in outside of sessions, including outdoor terraces and some rather nice bars.</li>
  <li><strong>Fancy ballroom</strong> - There's a main hall for keynote panels, performances and DJ sets, with concert quality AV.</li>
  <li><strong>No getting lost</strong> - The building layout is easy to navigate, and corridors and open spaces can handle heavy traffic.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendors inside</strong> - Plenty of vendors in the main convention space, with a dedicated room and further tables in open areas.
  <li><strong>Friendly staff</strong> - We're confident in both their and our planning for and commitment to this year's event.</li>
  <li><strong>Food and drink</strong> - The venue is taking account of the diversity of attendee requirements, and will be selling reasonably priced snacks, light food, and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. There are also dozens of other local food and drink options covering a wide range of requirements and price points.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - Our accessibility co-ordinator will update <a href="/access">last year's access guidance</a>, but much of it remains relevant for 2018.</li>
  <li><strong>Travel</strong> - The local area is well served by 24 hour tubes, buses, and taxi services. It's easily reachable from major train and coach stations, and is just off the A4 which continues on to Heathrow. We'll be updating the <a href="/2017/travel">2017 travel guidance</a> closer to the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Car parking</strong> - The hotel offers an hourly attendee rate for the on-site car park, with no overnight discounts. There's also NCP car parking at Shepherds Bush, which offers advance booking. We'll publish further information on local parking options closer to the event.</li>
  <li><strong>On-site accommodation</strong> - We have a block of 300 rooms for attendees and organisers at the same rate as 2017, and will get in touch with ticket holders once we're ready to open bookings for those.</li>
  <li><strong>Off-site accommodation</strong>- There are lots of other places to stay in the local area. We may agree special booking rates with some of them closer to the time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="novotel-rooms">What are the hotel bedrooms like?</h2>
The hotel rooms are in the same building as the convention spaces. They each feature a queen bed, en-suite bath or shower, sofa bed, large flexible work area, 32" LCD TV, pay movies and Internet access, broadband connection, hairdryer, iron, laptop safe, minibar, and tea/coffee. There are a very small number of twin rooms, so most twin requests are accommodated by making up the sofa bed. Wheelchair accessible bedrooms will be allocated via our access team.

<h2 id="accommodation">How do I book a hotel room?</h2>
If you want to stay on site (which we recommend), make sure you have a ticket and <strong>wait to hear from us once we're ready to go live</strong>. We're looking at running a priority booking period again as people found that helpful last year, and we'll get in touch about that and other access issues before we open room bookings. If you want to stay off-site, there are many other local accommodation options, from hostels to Airbnbs to B&Bs to chain hotels.

Room rates per night, including free breakfast, will be the same as previous years:
<ul>
<li>Single occupancy £95 - 1 adult, 0-2 children on sofa bed.</li>
<li>Double occupancy £105 - 2 adults sharing double bed, 0-2 children on sofa bed.</li>
<li>Triple occupancy £115 - 2 adults sharing double bed, 1 adult on sofa bed.</li>
</ul>
You'll need to use a credit or debit card to book, but payment will not be taken until your stay. Bookings are cancellable and refundable until 7 days prior to your stay. VAT is included. Please be aware that, while we will be advocating for your needs with the hotel, your agreement is with them.
